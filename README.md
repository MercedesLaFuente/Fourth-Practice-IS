### IMPORTANT! HOW TO USE :hammer:
* For a better reading of the document desable dark mode if your git is configured that way because the formulas in latex do not change the font color to white so it is lost with the background.
* Clone from the main repository using: 

     -git clone (repository link)
* For the correct functioning of the code you first need to install numpy and matplotlib from the console with the following command:                   

     -pip install numpy

     -pip install matplotlib
* Insert in the console terminal 'python operations.py' to start the program
* The program will ask you to enter the size of the chromosome population, the number of genes it will have, its probability of crossover and mutation.

## PROBLEM SOLVER AGENT ‚öôÔ∏è

### Objective Formulation:
Implement a genetic algorithm that allows to create new generations and from these to find the chromosome with the fitness function.

### Problem Formulation:

### Initial State:
A population of 100 chromosomes with random values varying from 0 to 1 and each with 20 genes.  

![Cromosomas](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74753713/134265512-3477ec4f-3f20-4f2b-8e10-1327aee62dd1.png)

### Objective State:
A generation of chromosomes that has one chromosome that gives its maximum fitness function of the entire population.

### Test of Objective:
Does the new generation of chromosomes have one that gives the maximum fitness function?
  
### Actions:
* Selection
* Crossover
* Mutation


## DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM
Generate a genetic algorithm that uses the three operations of selection, crossover and mutation where each chromosome has a size of 20 genes formed by 0 and 1 randomly and with a fitness function that is the sum of all the 1's it has.

## SOLUTION DESCRIPTION
The program allows to generate a population of n chromosomes with m genes that can result in new generations with the same dimensions until a population is found that has a chromosome that maximizes the fitness function. 

## EXPERIMENTS :round_pushpin:
#### 1. Execute the algorithm 20 times, for each run report in which generation the strongest chromosome was found. It reports the average of this value.

After the execution of the experiments carried out in the previous points, all the resulting data were taken as a reference to be able to work with them making a comparison table taking first as a priority the time in which the parameters that obtained a better performance are those of a probability of crossover of 0.7 and of mutation of 0. 001 which are executed in 0.85 seconds, now taking as priority the number of the resulting generation with the fastest maximum fitness function found, it was obtained that its resulting parameters are those of a probability of croosover of 0.7 and a probability of mutation of 0 which gives us 6 as the generation with the maximum fitness function.
It can be evidenced that a crossover probability that is less or more than 0.7 does not give us an optimal solution in terms of time and generations but all this individually since the results of the averages show that the more croosover you have, the average of all the populations that were generated will find the maximum function in one of their chromosomes faster than with a low croosover due to the continuous exchange of genes which gives a higher probability of finding the maximum fitness function.
Reviewing exhaustively the results that perform worse, it can be seen that those with a lower probability of croosover are the ones that less quickly find the chromosome that maximizes the function, so also the probability of mutation being so low does not affect in a radical way the improvement or worsening of the execution of the program.
