## NAMES üìã
* Balderrama Mauricio
* Canedo Juan Luis
* La Fuente Mercedes

### IMPORTANT! HOW TO USE :hammer:
* For a better reading of the document desable dark mode if your git is configured that way because the formulas in latex do not change the font color to white so it is lost with the background.
* Clone from the main repository using: 

     -git clone (repository link)
* For the correct functioning of the code you first need to install numpy and matplotlib from the console with the following command:                   

     -pip install numpy

     -pip install matplotlib
* Insert in the console terminal 'python operations.py' to start the program
* The program will ask you to enter the size of the chromosome population, the number of genes it will have, its probability of crossover and mutation.

## PROBLEM SOLVER AGENT ‚öôÔ∏è

### Objective Formulation:
Implement a genetic algorithm that allows to create new generations and from these to find the chromosome with the fitness function.
  
### Problem Formulation:

### Initial State:
A population of 100 chromosomes with random values varying from 0 to 1 and each with 20 genes.

### Objective State:
A generation of chromosomes that has one chromosome that gives its maximum fitness function of the entire population.

### Test of Objective:
Does the new generation of chromosomes have one that gives the maximum fitness function?
  
### Actions:
* Selection
* Crossover
* Mutation
